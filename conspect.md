# Some notes
- It's possible not only files but folders
- Git can't see empty folders by default
- **.gitignore** is a special file in the directory which stores some namings Git will ignore (don't add / or commit in case of 'all')
- Changes added to the file after indexing aren't gonna be in the indexing area
- It's important commits to be atomic which means they should contain small changes - not some enormous additions of functionality
- *!Commit early. Commit often!*
